Welcome to my homepage!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Hong Kong. I will be on the job market in 2025.

Research Interests: Macroeconomics, Information and Expectations, Business Cycle.

I am especially interested in the implications of information friction and heterogeneous expectations in macroeconomics. I also have a broad interest in heterogeneous expectations across regions.
