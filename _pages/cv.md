* Heterogeneous Expectation Uncertainty and News Shock (Job Market Paper)
  Abstract: In this paper, I document systematic differences in households' individual belief uncertainty regarding macroeconomic conditions and its relation to portfolio choices. I develop a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian model characterized by endogenous information acquisition and portfolio allocation. I demonstrate how the impact of an anticipated TFP shock is amplified through heterogeneous expectations. Quantitatively, the model aligns with observed household uncertainty and portfolio shares. Compared to a representative agent model, the impact of an anticipated TFP shock is amplified by nearly two times.
